# Weather app

Replace this readme with your own information about the project. You can include things like:

- Brief description of the assignment
- How you approached the task, what tools and techniques you used, and how you planned it
- If you had more time, what would be next?

# Assignment
- To make a weather app
- Fetch data, present information on the app: city name, current temperature, weather description, sunrise/sunset time, 4-day forecast
- Style the app

# Approach
- Made basic html
- Started styling to get an idea of the layout and colors, using design2 as a template
- Gave tags id/class
- When I had the main styling for mobile done I started on the js
- Worked on fetches
- Made changes as I continued to both HTML, CSS and Javascript
- Added things like changing background, arrows to swwitch between forecasts, 

- Used Visual Studios for the main code
- Codepen to test code
- Codepen and browser for testing and editing bits of code to make it work
- AI to help me find mistakes in the code and to point out improvements

# Possible changes
- Making the code better
- Working on getting todays forecast with mid day icon, min/max temp on the forecast page without it sometimes showing up twice as it did on my attempts.
- Work more with styling
- Make the dropdown prettier
- Add another page for getting hourly forecast on the coming days when you click it. Think payed version of Open Weather Map is needed.
