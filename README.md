# Weather app

Replace this readme with your own information about the project. You can include things like:

- Brief description of the assignment
- How you approached the task, what tools and techniques you used, and how you planned it
- If you had more time, what would be next?

# Assignment
- To make a weather app
- Fetch data, present information on the app: city name, current temperature, weather description, sunrise/sunset time, 4-day forecast
- Style the app

# Approach
- Made basic html, with the containers needed for the layout
- Tried to follow one of the given designs, as the assignment required
- Started styling to get an idea of the layout and colors
- Made an object with alternative icons to swap with, to make it more similar to the design
- Added containers and elements I needed
- When I had the main styling for mobile done I started on the js
- Worked on fetches
- First the current weather for the upper half. This was a more basic fetch, using different extensions to get the information I wanted and changing the content with it
- the forecast fetches was more complicated, and ended up splitting the four day forecast in two to make it work the way I wanted
- Started styling for other screen sizes
- Made changes as needed to the HTML, CSS and Javascript, fixing broken code, when incorrect information was displayed and so on.
- Added things like changing background on sunset/sunrise, arrows to switch between forecasts, favorite function, made timezone offset, swapped to make todays hourly forecast as the first page, and four day forecast when using the arrow button
- Created error messages
- Tried to make the code less complex and improve readability by extracting code from the fetch and making more manageable snippets of code, andcaling for them in the fetch
- Added switch and animations.
- Noticed arctic areas with no sunset/sunrise got the wrong background. Made changes.

# Tools
- Used Visual Studios for the main code
- OpenWeathermap API
- Codepen to test code
- Codepen and browser for testing and editing bits of code to make it work
- AI to help me find mistakes in the code, to point out improvements and explaining concepts and bits of code.

# Possible changes
- Making the code better
- Working on getting todays forecast with mid day icon, min/max temp on the forecast page without it sometimes showing up twice as it did on my attempts.
- Work more with styling
- Make the dropdown prettier
- Add another page for getting hourly forecast on the coming days when you click it. Think payed version of Open Weather Map is needed
- learn enough to make the code more readable and better
